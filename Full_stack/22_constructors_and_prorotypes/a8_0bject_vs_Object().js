// object vs Object();

//Object() as seen previously is a constructor function(like vehicle)
//all functions in js directly or indirectly are inherited 
// from this Object() constructor function in js


// while object is non primitive datatype in js
//this object is actually a collection of key value pairs
//ex:- var obj={};
//typeOf(obj)
//output="object"

// while typeof(Object) will print "function"
// because ita a constructor function in js to which all objects are made form
